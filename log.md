# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Commented out ideas for Web page layout. Laid down HTML framework.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't sure where to start but I had a rough idea of how I wanted the page to look so I wrote it all out and now I know where to pick up tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
