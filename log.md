# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Commented out ideas for Webpage layout. Laid down HTML framework.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't sure where to start but I had a rough idea of how I wanted the page to look so I wrote it all out and now I know where to pick up tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created fixed navagation bar with bootstrap. Added a bio section to the webpage with round image and text. 

**Thoughts**: I'm having a hard time laying out my elements. The fixed navagation bar lays over my heading and image at the top of the page. I fixed it with some margins and padding in CSS but it seems like a bandaid. I'm also having trouble centering my paragraph element under my .lead paragraph element.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
